<p><em>December 8 2023</EM>: And 13 years later, here's an update. Not much new on the site. Just a move to AWS Cloud hosting. More NIN tracks were completed and need to be uploaded somewhere. Maybe in 2024. Stay tuned.
</p>

<p><em>June 13 2010</EM>: Last month I bought a new computer. A MacBook Pro. Yum. This week I finally got around to looking at GarageBand. Nice. Today I remixed "Me, I'm Not". Awesome. So good it hurts. Currently under review on <a target="nin" href="http://remix.nin.com">remix.nin.com</a>. Watch this space.
</p>

<p><em>June 9 2010</EM>: iPhone game developer - <a href="http://www.reptiliaware.com">reptiliaware</a> - use the track "Andy Made Me Do It" from <a href="virtual.html">Virtual</a> as the soundtrack for the game "<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bubbloid/id375867088?mt=8">Bubbloid</a>" - available for free on the iTunes App Store. <br><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bubbloid/id375867088?mt=8"><img src="as.jpg"></a>.
</p>

<p><em>March 12 2010</EM>: Time for an update. Life's been busy. As usual - those journal papers just don't write themselves. I'm still excited by Y34RZ3r0r3mix3d and actually finished 3 tracks in 2009 - "<a href="nin3.html">3 X NIN3"</a>. "New" track done tonight. Hopefully it will get approved online tomorrow.
</p>

<p><em>August 31 2008</EM>: What's new? Not much by the look of it. Nearly exactly two years since the last update. However, things have been chugging along. In 2007, I finished a new album "<a href="reform.html">Reform Place"</a>. Eight tracks of electro goodness. And if you are lucky enough to get a hardcopy - a video! I'm currently looking for some online space to upload some of the tracks so keep your eyes here. At the moment I'm pretty excited by the NIN Remix album of Year One. A fantastic album and it comes with all the data from Year One. I'm currently making my own remix of "The Great Destroyer". One of many to come.
</p>

<p><em>August 17 2006</EM>: New MP3s uploaded to new music on the <a target="c4" href="http://www.channel4.com/apps26/userpages/UserPage/bands/viewUserPage?resourceId=688569neD">Channel 4</a> site. Includes Mimic (my NIN tribute ;) , Anton's Song (my BJM tribute :>) and Galapagos (my entry for the <a  target="bbc" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newtalent/music/newcomposers/">BBC New TV Composer Scheme</a>).
</p>

<p><em>May 25 2006</EM>: Busy couple of months. Finished a new song "Motus Destructus" that I'm in the process of mixing to a CD friendly version. Currently working on a TV soundtrack on the Galapagos Islands as the BBC are looking for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newtalent/music/newcomposers/">new TV composers</a>. Show your love for DM - buy a track today at  <a href="http://www.indiestore.com/deliriummotus">IndieStore.com</a> - 99p per track .... bargain.
</p>

<p><em>January 9 2006</EM>: Just watched "<a target="dig" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388888/">Dig!</a>", featuring one of my favorite bands - <a target="DW" href="http://www.dandywarhols.com">The Dandy Warhols</a> - and a band I'd not heard before - <a target="BJM" href="http://www.brianjonestownmassacre.com">The Brian Jonestown Massacre</a>. Great movie. The next day I wrote this - <a href="mp3/anton.mp3">Anton's Song</a>.
</p>

<p><em>January 6 2006</EM>: Happy New Year one and all. Added links to <a href="mp3/lostinapollo.mp3">Lost in Apollo</a> and <a href="mp3/mimic.mp3">Mimic</a> to the <a href="audio.html">Audio</a> page.
</p>

<p><em>December 16 2005</EM>: I've been learning about <a target="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321385551/qid=1134743489/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_11_2/026-9295560-2580437">web standards</a> and slowly rebuilding the sites I manage. So welcome to the new look <a href="index2.html">DM site</a>.
</p>
<p><em>December 12 2005</EM>: Found a new band hosting site and promptly signed up. Check out tracks for streaming, download and ringtones (!?) at <a target="beta" href="http://www.betarecords.com/delirium.motus">Beta Records</a>.
</p>
<p><em>December 9 2005</EM>: Created "<a href="demolisten.html">DemoListen</a>" specifically for submission to <a target="un" href="http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?id=94145">Xfm Unsigned</a>. It's a bit different to the usual guitar bands they list, so it will be interesting to see what happens.
</p>
<p><em>September 4 2005</EM>:... but wait ... there's <a href="mp3/lostinapollo.mp3">more</a>.
</p>
<p><em>June 16 2005</EM>: "<a href="processed.html">Processed</a>" is done and dusted. Finally mixed a stereo friendly version and printed all the cover art and disc labels. It looks and sounds great. Very limited run CD this time ... 8 at the moment, so a real collector's item (Dave and Shelley, I have copies set aside for you .. email <a href="mailto:shamus@btvsccg.co.uk">me</a> :).&nbsp;With exams and all, this term has been quieter, so have been working on&nbsp;new material. Two&nbsp;songs finished and waiting for final mixing. Here's a new one called "<a href="mp3/mimic.mp3">Mimic</a>" inspired by Trent. I think it has more bite (boom boom) than my usual, so I'm happy.
</p>
<p><em>March 1 2005</EM>: Long time and no update. New job and new town ... what can I say .... I've been busy. But never fear, the new album will soon be unleased upon the world. "Processed" is going through the last stages of production. The cover art is sorted and I'm almost at a Hi-Fi friendly mix. Once I get the last mixing done and the cd labels printing ok, we should be good to go. Watch this space.
</p>
<p><I>June 8 2004</I>: Busy week. Three new songs completed. First new one "Breathe" is up on the newly created <A href="http://music.download.com/deliriummotus/3600-8368_32-100089136.html">CNET music.download.com</A> (the new owners of mp3.com). It's my resident-evil-movie-zombie-killing-game-soundtrack song. Enjoy.
</p>
<p><I>April 1 2004</I>: So MP3.com is dead. Oh dear. So I'm currently removing all the links to the songs that used to be hosted there. Check out the <A href="audio.html">audio</A> page for the online locations of DM songs.
</p>
<p><I>November 3 2003</I>: MP3.com finally approve "Let Me In". Yay. This track is a result of Front Line Assembly poisoning and closer to the music I actually like. Bonus. Also picked up Magix Soundpool 1-4 on eBay the other day. 20 cds, that's right, 20 cds with 20,000 samples. Woo hoo. Should keep me entertained for a while.</p>

<p><I>October 26 2003</I>: These webpages go online. It's been a busy couple of weeks. These webpages have been constructed including scanning and cleaning up the cover art from the early albums. Also wrote a new track on Wednesday night. I'm suffering from Front Line Assembly poisoning at the moment which is a good thing as the new track is closer to the music I like. It's going though the "approval" wait at mp3.com at the moment but hopefully it will be online in a couple of days. Also set up a DM page on <A href="http://www.soundclick.com/deliriummotus">www.soundclick.com</A>. No mp3 quotas there or approval waiting (yet) so all of "<a href="virtual.html">Virtual</a>" is now online for download and streaming.</p>
